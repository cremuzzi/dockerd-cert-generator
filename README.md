# Dockerd PKI Helpers

a collection of scripts to help with the creation of a CA, server and client keys with OpenSSL.

Based on the official Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/).

## Key generation for your CA

```
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca-key.pem 4096
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus

e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:

$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem
